Suppose the rectangular box $E=[a,b] \times [c,d] \times [r,s]$ has a **density function** $p(x,y,z)$, meaning that at the points $(x,y,z)$ in $E$, the density is $p(x,y,z)$, where **density means units of mass per unit of volume.**  $(p= \frac{m}{v})$

## Triple Integrals

Now, we define the triple integral:

$$
\int \int \int _{E} p(x,y,z) \ dV
$$

In complete analogy with Riemann Sums in single and double integrals, we sub-divide $E$ into $m \times n \times \lambda$ sub-boxes:

We know the Riemann Sum will look like:

$$
\sum_{i=1}^m \sum _{j=1}^n \sum _{k=1}^\lambda p(x^*,y^*,z^*) \ \nabla V
$$

>[!Abstract] Interpretation
> In $(sub-box)_{ijk}$, $p(x^*,y^*,z^*)$ is the density at point $(x^*,y^*,z^*)$, and $\nabla V$ is the volume element, the volume of the sub-box. The summand can therefore be interpreted as:
>
> $$p(x^*,y^*,z^*)\nabla V = (Density)(Volume) = Mass$$

In the Riemann Sum, we are adding up the mass of the volume elements, approaching the total mass as $m_{1}n_{1}\lambda \rightarrow \infty$.

## Triple Integrals over "Rectangular" Regions

The triple integral of $f(x,y,z)$ over $E = [a,b] \times [c,d] \times [r,s]$ is:

$$
\int \int \int_{E} f(x,y,z) \ dV = \lim_{ m,n,\lambda \to \infty }\sum_{i=1}^m \sum _{j=1}^n \sum _{k=1}^\lambda f(x^*,y^*,z^*) \ \nabla V
$$

$$
= \int_{a}^b \int_{c}^d \int_{r}^s f(x,y,z) \ dz \ dy \ dx
$$

> [!Abstract] Remarks
> 1. The interpretation is mass (discussed above), or "hyper-volume" between the surface $f(x,y,z)$ (in 4D) and integration region E
> 2.  Fubini's Theorem still holds, but now there are six orders of integration: $dx \ dy \ dz, \ dx \ dz, \ dy, \ dy \ dx \ dz, \ dy \ dz, \ dx, dz \ dz , \ dy, \ dz \ dy \ dx$
> 3. We calculate the integrated integrals like before ,but with one more iteration.

## Triple Integrals over General Regions

Most regions we encounter will be non-rectangular and simple.

> [!Info] Type 1 Region
> ![[Screenshot 2024-10-23 at 12.06.57 PM.png]]

A Type 1 region is contained between two continuous surfaces $z_{1}(x,y)$ and $z_{2}(x,y)$. $\mathcal{D}$ is the projection of E onto the xy-plane. We integrate out z by running between the surfaces $z_{1}$ and $z_{2}$, then integrate over the region $\mathcal{D}$, using techniques we have from double integration.

> [!Example] 
> Evaluate $\int \int \int_{E} z \ dV$, where E is the solid tetrahadron bounded by the planes $x=0$, $y=0$, $z=0$, and $x+y+z=1$.

> [!Success] Solution
> **Always sketch the solid E.**
>
> > [!Info] Sketch

> > ![[Screenshot 2024-10-23 at 12.10.44 PM.png|350]]

E is bounded between the planes $z=0$ and $z=1-x-y$, so it's a Type 1 region. By the above formula,

$$
\int \int \int_{E}z \ dV = \int \int_{\mathcal{D}} \int_{0}^{1-x-y}z \ dz \ dA
$$

**Sketch $\mathcal{D}$, the projection of E onto the xy-plane.**

> [!Info] Sketch
> ![[Screenshot 2024-10-23 at 12.13.06 PM.png|350]]

$\mathcal{D}$ is a Type 1 region:

$$
0 \leq x \leq 1, \ \ \ 0 \leq y \leq 1 -x
$$

We can now write the integral as:

$$
\int \int \int_{E} \ z \ dV = \int \int_{\mathcal{D}} \int_{0}^{1-x-y} z \ dz \ dA = \int_{0}^1 \int_{0}^{1-x} \int_{0}^{1-x-y}z \ dz \ dy \ dx
$$

To show how the triple integration works, we carry out $I_{1}$ ( of 3 ):

$$
I_{1}: \ \ \int_{0}^{1-x-y}z \ dz = \left. \frac{z^2}{2}\right|_{0}^{1-x-y}= \frac{(1-x-y)^2}{2}
$$

The problem is now the double integral

$$
\int_{0}^1 \int_{0}^{1-x} \frac{(1-x-y)^2}{2} \ dy \ dx = \frac{1}{24}
$$

## Type 2 and Type 3 Regions

>[!Info] Type 2
> ![[Screenshot 2024-10-23 at 12.19.45 PM.png|350]]

**Type 2** regions are contained between a "front" and "back" surface.

$$
\int \int \int_{E} f(x,y,z) \ dV = \int \int_{\mathcal{D}} \int_{x_{1}(y,z)}^{x_{2}(y,z)} f(x,y,z) \ dx \ dA
$$

> [!Info] Type 3
> ![[Screenshot 2024-10-23 at 12.21.50 PM.png|350]]

**Type 3** regions are contained between a "left" and "right" surface. 

$$
\int \int \int_{E} f(x,y,z) \ dV = \int \int_{\mathcal{D}} \int_{y_{1}(x,z)}^{y_{2}(x,z)}f(x,y,z) \ dy \ dA
$$

---

> [!Example]
> Write the integral from the previous example in another order, integrating first with respect to **y**

> [!Info] Sketch
> ![[Screenshot 2024-10-23 at 12.26.36 PM.png|350]]

**As a Type 3 Region:**

$$
0 \leq y \leq 1-x-z
$$

To get integration limits on `x` and `y`, we need to sketch $\mathcal{D}$.

> [!Info] Sketch
> ![[Screenshot 2024-10-23 at 12.31.53 PM.png|350]]

**As a Type 1 region, $\mathcal{D}$ has bounds:**

$$
0 \leq z \leq 1-x, \ \ \ 0 \leq x \leq 1
$$

We can write the triple integral as:

> [!Success] Solution
>
> $$
> \int_{0}^1 \int_{0}^{1-x} \int_{0}^{1-x-z} z \ dy \ dz \ dx
> $$

> [!Warning] Remark
> We could also express E as a Type 2 region, or $\mathcal{D}$ as a Type 2 region; 6 possibilities in total.

## Finding Volume with Triple Integrals

The expression:

$$
\int \int \int _{E} 1 \ dV = \sum \sum \sum \Delta V
$$

says "add up all of the volume elements in E." Therefore:

$$
\int \int \int_{E} 1 \cdot dV = V(E) = Volume \ of \ E
$$

Let's apply this with an example.

---

> [!Example]
> Find the volume of the tetrahedron bounded by the planes:
>
> $$x + 2y+z=2, \ \ \ x=2y, \ \ \ x=0, \ \ \ and \ z=0$$
>
> [!Success]- Solution
> We have to **sketch the solid** $x+2y+z=2$ in the first octant and intersect it with the plane $x=2y$
>
> >[!Info] Sketch
> > 
> > ![[Screenshot 2024-10-24 at 11.47.58 AM.png]]

> [!Abstract] Remark
> We obtain the bounds on $\mathcal{D}$ from the sketch of the solid. The plane $x+2y+z=2$ intersects the xy-plane $(z=0)$ in the line $x+2y=2$, or $y=1-\left( \frac{x}{2} \right)$. The lower boundary comes from re-writing $x=2y$ as $y=\frac{x}{2}$

The volume is therefore:

$$
V = \int \int \int_{E} dV = \int_{0}^1 \int_{\frac{x}{2}}^{1- \frac{x}{2}} \int_{0}^{2-x-2y} = \frac{1}{3}
$$

`2-x-2y` comes from $x+2y+z=2; \ \ \ solve \ for \ Z$
