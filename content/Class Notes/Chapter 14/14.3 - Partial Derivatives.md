**Abstract:** We know that derivatives on the 2d plane find the slope of the line at that point, but what does the derivative find on the 3d plane?

We can also find the slope in the direction of the z-axis by taking the partial derivative with respect to z.

## Example: Find $f_{x}$ and $f_{y}$

**1**. 

We are given:

$$ f(x,y) = x^2 y^5 $$

Finding $f$ with respect to x:

$$ f_{x} = y^5 (2x) = 2xy^5 $$

Finding $f$ with respect to y:

$$ f_{y} = 5y^4x^2 $$

**2**.

Finding $\frac{\partial z}{\partial x}$ and $\frac{\partial z}{\partial y}$

$$z = \frac{y^2}{(1+x^2)^3}$$

Lets solve.

$$ \frac{\partial z}{\partial x} = y^2 \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \frac{1}{(1+x^2)} = y^2 \frac{\partial}{\partial x} (1+x)^{-3}$$

This then becomes:

$$= y^2 (-3)(1+x^2)^{-4}(2x) = -\frac{6xy^2}{(1+x^2)^4}$$

Solving for $\frac{\partial z}{\partial y}$

$$ \frac{\partial z}{\partial y} = \frac{2y}{(1+x^2)^3}$$

## Practice Problems

Given:

$$
f = \int_{x}^y \cos(e^t)dt = -\int_{y}^x\cos(e^t)dt
$$

$$
f_{y} = \frac{\partial}{\partial y}\left[ \int_{x}^y\cos(e^t)dt \right] 
$$

$$
(f_{x})_{x} = f_{x x}

$$

$$
f= x^2+y^2+e^x
$$

$$
f_{x x} = 6x + y^2e^x
$$

$$
f_{x y} = (f_{x})_{y} = 2ye^x
$$
