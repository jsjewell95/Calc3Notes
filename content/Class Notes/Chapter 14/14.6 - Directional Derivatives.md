Directional Derivatives serve to help us understand how a function changes in a particular direction. The gradient is a vector that points in the direction of the steepest increase of a function. The gradient is a generalization of the derivative to functions of multiple variables.

## Abstract

_example graph_

```python
import micropip
await micropip.install("matplotlib")
await micropip.install("numpy")

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D
from matplotlib import cm

# Create figure and 3D axis
fig = plt.figure()
ax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d')

# Define the grid for the plane
x = np.linspace(-5, 5, 30)
y = np.linspace(-5, 5, 30)
x, y = np.meshgrid(x, y)
z = 0.5 * x + 0.2 * y  # Equation of a plane: z = 0.5x + 0.2y

# Plot the plane
ax.plot_surface(x, y, z, cmap=cm.viridis, alpha=0.6)

# Define a point on the plane
point = np.array([2, 1, 0.5 * 2 + 0.2 * 1])  # (x, y, z) = (2, 1, 1.2)

# Plot the point
ax.scatter(point[0], point[1], point[2], color='r', s=100)

# Define a direction vector
direction = np.array([1, 1, 0.5 * 1 + 0.2 * 1])  # Vector with slope matching the plane

# Normalize the direction for plotting an arrow
direction_normalized = direction / np.linalg.norm(direction)

# Plot the direction as an arrow from the point
ax.quiver(point[0], point[1], point[2], direction_normalized[0], direction_normalized[1], direction_normalized[2], color='b', length=2, arrow_length_ratio=0.2)

# add a projection at the bottom of the graph of where the direction vector is pointing
ax.plot([point[0], point[0] + direction_normalized[0]], [point[1], point[1] + direction_normalized[1]], [0, 0], color='b', linestyle='--')

# Set labels
ax.set_xlabel('X axis')
ax.set_ylabel('Y axis')
ax.set_zlabel('Z axis')
ax.set_title('3D Plane with Point and Direction')

# Show plot
plt.show()

```

Given $z = f(x,y)$ and the point $z_{0} = f(x_{0}, y_{0})$ we seek the slope of the tangent line at $z_{0}$ in the direction of **the unit vector $\vec{u}$**

We are seeking to find the secant line $m_{secant}$ that passes through the point $(x_{0}, y_{0}, z_{0})$ and $(x_{0} + a, y_{0} + b, z_{0} + c)$

For this purpose, we will use the abstract equation:

$$m_{secant} = \frac{vertical \space change}{horizontal \space change}$$

Where:

- **vertical change** is the change in z coordinates
- **horizontal change** is the change in x and y coordinates

Plugging in the imaginary values:

$$= \frac{f(x_{1},y_{1}) - f(x_{0},y_{0})}{|\vec{u}t|}$$

Where:

- $x_{1} = x_{0} + at$ is the x coordinate of the point on the secant line
- $y_{1} = y_{0} + bt$ is the y coordinate of the point on the secant line
- $z_{1} = z_{0} + ct$ is the z coordinate of the point on the secant line
- $\vec{u} = <a, b>$ is the direction vector

Putting this all together, we get a graph that looks something like this:

### In Layman's Terms

Essentially, the directional derivative is a measure of how a function changes in a specific direction. The gradient is a vector that points in the direction of the steepest increase of a function. The gradient is a generalization of the derivative to functions of multiple variables.

### Proofs

> [!Info] Definition
> $\lim_{ t \to 0 } \frac{{f(x_{0}+u_{1}t, y_{0}+u_{2}t) - f(x_{0},y_{0})}}{t} = D_{\vec{u}}f(x_{0},y_{o})$
> Directional Derivative of f at $(x_{0},y_{0})$ in the direction of $\vec{u}$,
> where $\vec{u}$ is unit vector
> $D_{\vec{u}}f(x_{0},y_{0}) = \nabla f(x_{0},y_{0}) \cdot \vec{u}$

### Key Formula

>[!Info] Formula
>
> $$\nabla f = \partial f \partial x, \partial f \partial y$$
>
> This enables us to calculate the directional derivative in an arbitrary direc- tion, by taking the dot product of âˆ‡f with a unit vector, u, in the desired direction.

## Example

> [!Example]
> Find the directional derivative of:
> $f(x,y) = x^2y^3-4y$ at the point $(2,-1)$
> in the direction of $\vec{v}= \langle 2,5 \rangle$

Lets start by finding the gradient of $f(x,y)$:

> [!Tip]
> Always normalize the direction vector into a unit vector

$$ D\_{\vec{u}}f(2,-1) = \nabla f \cdot \vec{u} = \langle \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \rangle \cdot \langle \frac{2}{\sqrt{29}}, \frac{5}{\sqrt{29}} \rangle$$

After finding the gradient, we can plug in the values:

$$ = \frac{4x^2y^3-4y}{\sqrt{29}}$$

Conclusively, the directional derivative of $f(x,y)$ at the point $(2,-1)$ in the direction of $\vec{v}$ is $\frac{4x^2y^3-4y}{\sqrt{29}}$

**Conclusion:**

The directional derivative of $f(x,y)$ at the point $(2,-1)$ in the direction of $\vec{v}$ is $\frac{4x^2y^3-4y}{\sqrt{29}}$
