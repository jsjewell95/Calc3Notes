**Cylinderical Coordinates** are the three-dimensional analogue of polar coordinates. They are useful for describing regions with rotational symmetry.

In cylindrical coordinates, the point **P**$(r,\theta,z)$ means the following:

- $r$ and $\theta$ are the polar coordinates of the projection of **P** onto the xy-plane.
- $z$ is the distance from **P** to the xy-plane

The relationship between cylindrical and Cartesian coordinates is:

$$
x = r\cos \theta, \ \ y = r\sin \theta, \ \ \ z=z
$$

This comes from the fact that the x- and y-coordinates of a point in cylindrical coordinates can be expressed in polar. We also have:

x^2 + y^2 = r^2

## Applications

> [!Example]
> Plot the point with cylinderical coordinates $\left( 2, \frac{2\pi}{3}, 1 \right)$ and convert to rectangular coordinates.

> [!Success]- Solution
> To plot $(r,\theta,z) = (2, \frac{2\pi}{3}, 1)$, plot $(r,\theta) = (2, \frac{2\pi}{3})$ in polar coordinates in the xy-plane, then move vertically $z=1$ unit.

To find the rectangular coordinates, use the above formulae:

$$
X = r\cos \theta = 2\cos\left(  \frac{2\pi}{3} \right) = 2\left(  - \frac{1}{2} \right) = 1
$$

$$
Y = r\sin \theta = 2 \sin \left(  \frac{2\pi}{3} \right) = 2 \left(  \frac{\sqrt{ 3 }}{2} \right) = \sqrt{ 3 }
$$

$$
Z = z = z
$$

This yields a **rectangular result:**

$$
(-1,\sqrt{ 3 }, 1)
$$

## Triple Integrals in Cylinderical Coordinates

Suppose $E$ is a Type 1 region whose projection $\mathcal{D}$ onto the xy-plane can be described conveniently on polar coordinates.

$E$ is a Type 1 region, so it's bounded between the surfaces $z_{1}(x,y)$ and $z_{2}(x,y)$. We can therefore write:

$$
\int \int \int_{E} f(x,y,z) dV = \int \int_{\mathcal{D}} \int_{z_{1}(x,y)}^{z_{2}(x,y)} f(x,y,z) \ dz \ dA
$$

But we know how to integrate over $\mathcal{D}$ in polar coordinates:

$$
\int \int _{\mathcal{D}} \int_{z_{1}(x,y)} ^ {z_{2}(x,y)} f(x,y,z) \ dA = \int_{\alpha}^{\beta}\int_{r_{1}(\theta)}^{r_{2}(\theta)} \int_{z_{1}(x,y)}^{z_{2}(x,y)}f(x,y,z) \ r \ dz \ dr \ d\theta
$$

Converting x and y to polar coordinates, we have the result:

$$
\int \int \int_{E} f(x,y,z) dV = \int_{\alpha}^\beta \int_{r_{1}(\theta)}^{r_{2}(\theta)} \int_{z_{1}(r\cos \theta, r\sin \theta)}^{z_{2}(r\cos \theta, r\sin \theta)}f(r\cos \theta,r\sin \theta,z) \ r \ dz \ dr \ d\theta
$$

> [!Warning] Remarks
> 1. To integrate in cylindrical coordinates, we convert x and y to polar and leave z alone. We "run" z from the bottom surface to the top surface, then integrate over $r$ and $\theta$ as we did with double integrals in polar coordinates.
> 2. The expression $r\ dz \ dr \ d\theta$ represents the **volume element** in cyldindrical coordinates. The volume of the volume element is the area of the base times the height. But the base is the polar area element, whichi has area $r \Delta r \Delta \theta$, and the height is $\Delta z$, so we get:

> Observe that the projection of the surface onto the xy-plane is the disk $x^2 + y^2 \leq 4$. Algebraically, we can use this by setting $z=0$ in the equation $z=4-x^2 - y^2$.

1. **Obtain limits on z in cylindrical coordinates**

	As a Type 1 region, $0 \leq z \leq 4-x^2-y^2$. In cylindrical coordinates, $x^2 + y^2 = r^2$, so we get $0 \leq z \leq 4 - r^2$

2. **Express $\mathcal{D}$ in Polar Coordinates**

	The disk $x^2+y^2 \leq 4$ has polar bounds $0 \leq r \leq z$, $0 \leq \theta \leq 2\pi$

3. **Set-up and evalutate the integral**

$$
I_{1}: \ \ \ \int_{0}^{4-r^2} r^3 \cos^2 \theta \ dz = (4-r^2)r^3 \cos^2\theta
$$

$$
= (4r^3 - r^5)\cos^2 \theta
$$

$$
I_{2}: \ \ \ \int_{0}^2 (4r^3 - r^5) \cos^2 \theta \ dr = \left. \cos^2\theta\left( r^4 - \frac{r^6}{6} \right) \right|_{0}^2
$$

$$
= \frac{16}{3} \cos^2 \theta
$$

$$
I_{3}: \ \ \ \int_{0}^{2\pi} \frac{16}{3} \cos^2 \theta \ d\theta = \frac{8}{3} \int_{0}^{2\pi} 1+\cos(2\theta) \ d\theta
$$

$$
= \frac{16\pi}{3}
$$
