The **Fresnel integrals** are a pair of transcendental functions that arise in the study of wave optics, particularly in problems involving diffraction and interference. These integrals are defined as follows:

$$
S(x) = \int_0^x \sin\left( \frac{\pi t^2}{2} \right) dt
$$

$$
C(x) = \int_0^x \cos\left( \frac{\pi t^2}{2} \right) dt
$$

They are often written together as a parametric curve in the complex plane:

$$
Z(x) = C(x) + i S(x)
$$

> [!info] **Basic Properties**
> - Both $C(x)$ and $S(x)$ are odd functions: $C(-x) = -C(x)$ and $S(-x) = -S(x)$.
> - As $x \to \infty$, both $C(x)$ and $S(x)$ tend toward $\frac{1}{2}$, leading to:
>
> $$ \lim_{x \to \infty} C(x) = \lim_{x \to \infty} S(x) = \frac{1}{2} $$

## Applications

The Fresnel integrals are widely used in physics and engineering, including:

- **Wave optics**: They describe the intensity distribution in a diffraction pattern (e.g., near-field diffraction).
- **Signal processing**: They help in analyzing signals involving chirps or oscillations.
- **Electromagnetics**: They model certain problems in electromagnetic wave propagation.

> These approximations become useful for practical numerical computations.

## Plot of Fresnel Integrals

The parametric plot of $C(x)$ and $S(x)$ forms the well-known **Cornu spiral**, a tool used in optical design and diffraction analysis.

> [!quote] **Trivia**
> The Fresnel integrals were introduced by the French engineer **Augustin-Jean Fresnel** in the early 19th century during his studies on light diffraction.
