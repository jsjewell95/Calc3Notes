We will be evaluating double integrals as **iterated integrals**. We will explain why shortly, but first we will explain how iterated integrals work.

## Iterated Integrals Definitions

**An integral of the following form**

$$\int_{a}^b \int_{c}^d f(x,y)\ \color{red} dy\ \color{blue} dx $$

Means that we $\color{red}first$ integrate with respect to y ( holding x fixed ) from `c` to `d`, and $\color{blue}then$ integrate the result with respect to x from `a` to `b`

### However...

**An integral with this form**

$$\int_{c}^d \int_{a}^b \ f(x,y) \ \color{red} dx \ \color{blue} dy$$

Means something something a little similar, except that we integrate $\color{red}first$ with respect to `x`, and then $\color{blue}second$ with respect to `y`.

---

## Basic Example

$$\int _{0} ^ 3 \int_{1}^2 \ x^2 y \ dy \ dx = \int_{0}^3 \left[ \int_{1}^2 x^2y \ dy \right] \ dx$$

Integrate first with respect to `y`

$$= \int_{0}^3 \left[ \left. \frac{x^2y^2}{2} \right|_{y=1}^{y=2} \ \  \right] \ dx $$

FTC with `y=1, y=2`

$$= \int_{0}^3 \left( 2x^2 - \frac{1}{2} x^2 \right) dx$$

Simplify and integrate with respect to `x`

$$\int_{0}^3 \frac{3}{2} x^2 dx$$

$$= \left. \frac{1}{2}x^3 \right|_{0}^3 = \frac{27}{2}$$

Leaving us with our final answer $\frac{27}{2}$

## What if We Reverse the order of Integration?

Instead of doing it how we just did, we will instead evaluate the inner integral $\color{red}\int_{0}^3 \ and \ x \  limits$, inside of the outer integral $\color{blue} \int_{1}^2 \ with \ the \ y$ limits.

$$\color{blue} \int_{1}^2 \color{red} \int_{0}^3 \ x^2y \ dx \ \color{blue} dy  \color{grey}= \int_{1}^2 \left[ \int_{0}^3 x^2y \ dx \right] \ dy$$

## Proof of Fubini's Theorem

Imagine a 3D graph where:

[[Fubini Example|Alternative, but incomplete python graph]]

Another way we can calculate the volume integral (as an alternative to Riemann sums) is by adding up **vertical slabs** parallel to the x-axis. If we partition the interval $[c,d]$ on the y-axis into n sub-intervals of width:

$$\Delta y = \frac{d-c}{n},$$

we get:

$$Total \ Volume = \sum_{i=1}^n(Volume \ of \ slab \ i)$$

The volume of the $i^{th}$ slab is the area of the "front face" (face on the right in the figure) times the ==width==. But the **area of the front face** is merely the area under the trace curve obtained by intersecting the surface with the plane $y=y_{i} \dots$ in other words, a 2D integral. So:

$$(Volume \ of \ Slab \ i) = \left( \int_{a}^b f(x,y_{i})dx \right) \cdot \Delta y$$

This means the total volume is approximately:

$$Total \ Volume \approx \sum_{i=1}^n \left( \int_{a}^b f(x,y_{i})dx\right) \cdot \Delta y$$

Intuitively, the volume is exact in the limit $n \rightarrow \infty$:

$$Total \ Volume = \lim_{ n \to \infty } \sum_{i=1}^n \left( \int_{a}^b f(x,y_{i})dx \right)\Delta y$$

By definition of the Riemann integral:

$$= \int_{c}^d \int_{a}^b f(x,y) \ dx \ dy$$

---

A similar argument using slabs parallel to the y-axis shows:

$$Total \ Volume = \int_{a}^b \int_{c}^d f(x,y) \ dy \ dx,$$

and because earlier we defined 

$$Total \ Volume = \int \int_{R} f(x,y) \ dA$$

the result is proved.

>[!Info] Remark on the Area Element
> Fubini's Theorem reveals the the rectangular area element $dA$ is equal to $dy \ dx$

$$\int \int_{R} f(x,y) \ dA = \int_{a}^b \int_{c}^d f(x,y) \ dy \ dx$$

This aligns with the derivation at the [[15.1 - Multiple Integrals|beginning]] of these notes. If we partition $[a,b]$ into m sub-intervals of width $\Delta x = \frac{b-a}{m}$, and $[c,d]$ into n sub-intervals of width $\Delta y = \frac{d-c}{n}$, then the area of each $R_{ij}$ (see the [[15.1 - Multiple Integrals#Stencil|stencil]]) is $\Delta x \Delta y$.

## Example

>[!Example]
> Find the volume of hte solid that lies above the rectangle

> $$R = [0,2] \ \times [0,2]$$
>
> and below the elliptic paraboloid 
>
> $$z = 16-x^2-2y^2$$

>[!Success] Solution
> In [[15.1 - Multiple Integrals|15.1]], we estimated the volume with Mathematica. Here, we find it exactly using [[15.1.2 - Iterated Integrals#Proof of Fubini's Theorem|Fubini's Theorem]].

$$V = \int \int _{R} f(x,y) \ dA = \int_{0}^2 \int_{0}^2 16-x^2 - 2y^2 \ dx \ dy$$

A clean way to organize our work is by evaluating the inner integral (call it **$I_{1}$**) separately, then handling the outer integral (call it $I_{2}$).

**For $I_{1}$**

$$I_{1} = \int_{0}^2 16-x^2-2y^2 \ dx = \left. 16x - \frac{x^3}{3} - 2x^y \right|_{x=0}^{x=2}$$

$$I_{1}= 32 - \frac{8}{3} - 4y^2 = \frac{88}{3} - 4y^2$$

**For $I_{2}$**

$$I_{2} = \int_{0}^2 I_{1} \ dy = \int_{0}^2 \frac{88}{3} - 4y^2 \ dy$$

$$I_{2} = \left. \frac{88}{3} y - \frac{4}{3}y^3 \right|_{0}^2$$

$$I_{2} = \frac{88 \cdot 2}{3} - \frac{4 \cdot 8}{3}$$

$$I_{2} = \frac{1}{3}(176-32) = \frac{144}{3} = 48$$

>[!Success] Solution
> We have to be wise when choosing the order of integration. Here, we should integrate with respect to **x** first, because the integral with respect to **y** requires integration by parts.

$$\int \int _{R} y \sin(xy) \ dA = \int_{0}^\pi \int_{1}^2 y \sin(xy) \ dx \ dy$$

Integrate first with respect to **X**

$$I_{1}: \ \ \left. \int _{1}^2 y \sin(xy) \ dx =  -\cos(x,y) \right|_{x=1}^{x=2}$$

$$ = -\cos(2y) + \cos(y)$$

$$I_{2}: \ \ \int_{0}^\pi I_{1} \ dy = \int_{0}^\pi \cos(y) - \cos(2y) \ dy$$

From here, you can already tell its **zero**...

$$= \left. \sin(y) - \frac{1}{2} \sin (2y) \right|_{0}^\pi = 0$$

### Interpretation

We can interpret these integrals as "signed volume." In this example, the volume above the xy-plane is equal to the volume below the xy-plane. But volume beneath the xy-plane is considered "negative", so the two volumes cancel.

## Example of "Constant" Trickery

If $R = \left[ 0, \frac{\pi}{2} \right] \times [0, \frac{\pi}{2} ]$, then:

$$\int \int_{R} \sin x\cos y \ dA = \int_{0}^ \frac{\pi}{2} \int_{0}^ \frac{\pi}{2} \sin x\cos y \ dy \ dx$$

> [!Warning] Observe
> $\sin x$ is a constant with respect to $y$, so we can write:
>
> $$\int_{0}^ \frac{\pi}{2} \sin x\left( \int_{0}^ \frac{\pi}{2} \cos y \ dy \right) \ dx$$
>
> By the linearity of the integral

But when we evaluate the inner integral, we'll get a constant, which will move through the outer integral. We'll be left with:

$$\left( \int_{0}^ \frac{\pi}{2} \cos y \ dy \right)\left( \int_{0}^ \frac{\pi}{2} \sin x \ dx \right) = 1 \cdot 1 = 1$$

> [!Success] Moral
> If the integrand of an iterated integral can be factored into two functions dependent **only** on different variables, then we can evaluate the iterated integral as a product of two "standard" integrals:

$$\int \int f(x,y) \ dy \ dx = \int \int g(x)h(y) \ dy \ dx$$

$$= \int g(x) \ dx \ \ \cdot \ \ \int h(y) \ dy$$
