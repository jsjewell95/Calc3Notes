Suppose the curve $C$ in the xy-plane has the vector equation $\vec{r}(t) = \langle x(t),y(t) \rangle$. Suppose $C$ lies below the surface $z=f(x,y)$, and consider the problem of find the area of the **"sheet"** between the $C$ and the **surface**.

- $C$ is a curve in the xy-plane
- The blue space curve $L$ lives on the surface $z=f(x,y)$. It is the curve obtained by lifting $C$ to the surface
- WE seek the **area of the sheet** between $C$ and $L$.

We proceed the dividing $C$ into n sub-arcs. This is achieved by sub-dividing the parameter interval $[a,b]$ into n sub-intervals of width $\Delta t = \frac{(b-a)}{n}$.

The point $t_{i}$ in the parameter interval corresponds to the point on $C$ with position vector $P_{i}= \langle x(t_{i}), y(t_{i}) \rangle$

Let $\Delta \partial_{i}$ denote the length of the sub-arc between $P_{i}$ and $P_{i-1}$.

**Then:**

The area of the portion of the sheet above $\Delta \partial_{i}$ is approximately the area of the rectangle whose width is the length of $\Delta \partial_{i}$, and whose height is $f(x,y)$ evaluated at $P_{i}$. We obtain the **area of the sheet** by summing up all of these smaller portions of the sheet:

$$
Area \ of \ Sheet = \sum_{i=1}^n f(x(t_{i}),y(t_{i})) \ \Delta \partial_{i}
$$

[^1]

*But we already know $\Delta \partial i$ is the arc length differential(see [[13.3 - Arc Length|section 13.3a]])*

$$

\Delta \partial i = \sqrt{ (\dot{x}(t_{i}))^2 + (\dot{y}(t_{i}))^2 } \Delta t

$$

[^2]

where the "dot" notation means "derivative with respect to t", i.e. $\dot{x} = \frac{dx}{dt}$. Substituting [^2] into [^1] and taking the limit $n \to \infty$ yields an integral:

$$

Area \ of \ Sheet = \int_{a}^b f(x(t),y(t))\sqrt{ \dot{x}^2 + \dot{y}^2 } \ dt

$$

This particular integral is called the [[Line Integral]]:

> [!Info] Definition
> If $f$ is defined on the curve $C$ given by $\vec{r}(t)= \langle x(t), y(t) \rangle$,  $t \in [a,b]$, then the **line integral** of $f$ along $C$ is:

> $$

Now we know what we are looking for, let's go through the steps to evaluate:

1. Parameterize $C$
	- This is done by $\vec{r}(t) = \langle \cos t, \sin t \rangle$, $t \in [0,2\pi]$
2. Compute the Arc Length differential

$$
d\partial = | \vec{r}'(t) | dt = | \langle-\sin t, \cos t \rangle | dt
$$

$$
= \sqrt{ \sin^2t+\cos^2t } \ dt = dt
$$

3. Evaluate the line integral

$$
\int_{C} f(x,y) d\partial = \int_{0}^{2\pi} (1-x^2) \ d\partial
$$

$$
\int_{0}^1 \int_{0}^1 \frac{1}{1-xy} \ dx \ dy = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2}
$$

*substitute in $d\partial = dt$ and $x=\cos t$*

$$
= \int_{0}^{2\pi}(1-\cos^2t) \ dt
$$

$$
= \int_{0}^{2\pi}\sin^2t \ dt = \frac{1}{2} \int_{0}^{2\pi}1-\cos2t \ dt
$$

*remark: $\int_{0}^{2\pi}\sin^2\theta \ d\theta = \int_{0}^{2\pi}\cos^2 \theta \ d\theta = \pi$*

$$
= \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)(2\pi) = \pi
$$

## Line Integrals in Space

The concept of a [[Line Integral]] can be extended to space curves of the form $\vec{r}(t) = \langle x(t), y(t), z(t) \rangle$, $t \in [a,b]$:

$$
\int_{C}f(x,y,z) \ d\partial = \int_{a}^b f(x(t),y(t),z(t))\sqrt{ \dot{x}^2+ \dot{y}^2 + \dot{z}^2 } \ dt
$$

$$
= \int_{a}^b f( \vec{r}(t)) \ | \ \vec{r}'(t) \ | \ dt
$$

The analogy of the "area of the sheet" is now difficult because the "height" of the sheet is now in 4D. **Instead, we can interpret the line integral as the mass of a thin wire with shape $C$ and linear density function $f(x,y,z)$**

*why?* Because:

$$
(Linear \ Density) = \frac{mass}{length} \to mass = (Density)(Length)
$$

In the expression $\int_{C}f(x,y,z) \ d\partial$, $d\partial$ represents the length of a small piece of wire; so, if $f$ is density, $f \cdot d\partial$ is the mass of that piece. The integrand sign means "add up all the mass elements," yielding the total mass.

> [!Example]
> A helix-shaped wire described by $\vec{r}(t) = \langle\cos t, \sin t, t \rangle$, $t \in [0,2\pi]$, has linear density function $f(x,y,z) = y\sin z$. Find the mass of the wire.

> [!Success]- Solution
> We seek the line integral $\int_{C}y\sin z \ d\partial$, where $C$ is the helix. The arc length differential is:
>
> $$
> d\partial = \sqrt{ \dot{x}^2 + \dot{y}^2 + \dot{z}^2 } \ dt = \sqrt{ \sin^2t + \cos^2t +1  } \ dt = \sqrt{ 2 } \ dt
> $$
>
> The line integral (and mass) is therefore:
>
> $$
> \int_{C}y\sin z \ d\partial = \int_{0}^{2\pi} \sin^2t \cdot \sqrt{ 2 } \ dt = \sqrt{ 2 }\pi

## Line Integrals with respect to X, Y, or Z

So far, we have defined the line integral with respect to arc length, $d\partial$. Now we define the line integral with respect to $x,y, or z$:

$$
\int_{C}f(x,y,z) \ dx = \int_{a}^b f(x,y,z) \dot{x}(t) \ dt,
$$

$$
\int_{C} f(x,y,z) \ dy = \int_{a}^b f(x,y,z) \dot{y}(t) \ dt,
$$

$$
\int_{C} f(x,y,z) \ dz = \int_{a}^b f(x,y,z) \dot{z}(t) \ dt.
$$

> [!Abstract] Remarks
> 1. To obtain the formulae on the right, we observe:
>
> $$
> \dot{x}(t) = \frac{dx}{dt} \to dx = \dot{x}(t) \ dt
> $$
>
> 2. The geometric interpretation is less intuitive than the line integral with respect to arc length. The line integral with respect to x, for example, can be interpreted as the **area of the projection of the sheet onto the xz-plane** ( see the beginning for the sheet sketch, and then imagine that pushing against the xz-plane).
> 3. The utility of this type of integral will become apparent when we study line integrals of vector fields; for now, we are learning the mechanics of working with them.

> [!Example]

> c. $c$ is the arc of the parabola $x = 4 - y^2$ from $(-5,-3)$ to $(0,2)$.

### A.

We need to find a vector parameterization of the segment. Recall that the line segment joining $\vec{r}_{0} = \langle x_{0},y_{0} \rangle$ and $\vec{r}_{1}=\langle x_{1},y_{1} \rangle$ is $\vec{r}(t) = (1-t) \vec{r}_{0}+ t \vec{r}_{1}$, where $t \in [0,1]$. So, we get:

$$
\begin{align*}
\vec{r}(t) &= (1-t) \langle -5, -3 \rangle + t \langle 0, 2 \rangle \\ 
           &= \langle -5 + 5t, -3 + 3t \rangle + \langle 0, 2t \rangle \\
           &= \langle -5 + 5t, -3 + 5t \rangle \\
           &= \langle x(t), y(t) \rangle
\end{align*}
$$

Therefore:

$$
\begin{align*}
\int_{C} y^2 \ dx + x \ dy &= \int_{0}^1 (-3+5t)^2(5) + (-5+5t)(5) \ dt \\
&= 5 \int_{0}^1 9 - 30t + 25t^2 - 5 + 5t \\
& = 5 \int_{0}^1 25t^2 - 25t + 4 \ dt \\
&= - \frac{5}{6}
\end{align*}
$$

### B.

This is the same path, but we have reversed direction: 

We start at $(0,2)$ and end at $(-5,-3)$, so:

$$
\begin{align*}
\vec{r}(t) &= (1-t)\langle 0,2 \rangle + t \langle -5, -3 \rangle \\
&= \langle 0,2-2t \rangle + \langle -5t, -3t \rangle \\
&= \langle -5t, 2-5t \rangle = \langle x(t), y(t) \rangle, \ \ t \in [0,1]
\end{align*}
$$

Therefore, the line integral is:

$$
\begin{align*}
\int_{C}y^2 \ dx + x \ dy &= \int_{0}^1 (2-t_{5})^2(-5) + (-5t)(5) \ dt \\
&= -5 \int_{0}^1 (2-5t)^2 - 5t \ dt \\
&= -5 \int_{0}^1 4 - 20t + 25t^2-5t \\
&= -5 \int_{0}^1 25t^2 - 25t + 4 \ dt  \\
&= \frac{5}{6}
\end{align*}
$$

### C.

Parameterize the parabola by $x=4-y^2$, $y=y$, $y \in [-3,2]$:

$$
\begin{align*}
\int_{C} y^2 \ dx + x \ dy &= \int_{-3}^2 y^2 (-2y)+(4-y^2)(1) \ dy \\
&= \int_{-3}^2 -2y^2 + 4-y^2 \ dy \\
&= \frac{245}{6}
\end{align*}
$$

## Properties of Line Integrals

1. A parameterization $\vec{r}(t)$ of $C$ comes with an orientation. In the previous example [[16.2a - Line Integrals Of Scalar Fields#A.|A]] and [[16.2a - Line Integrals Of Scalar Fields#B.|B]], we had:

> [!Info] Sketch
> ![[Screenshot 2024-11-08 at 12.15.08 PM.png|350]]

If $-C$ denotes $C$ but traversed "backwards", then the previous example suggests:

$$
\int_{-C}f(x,y) \ dx = - \int_{C}f(x,y) \ dx
$$

[^3]

*i.e.* **reversing the orientation of $C$ flips the sign of the line integral.** ( This is the same idea as reversing the order of integration; one way, the $\Delta x$ values are negative. )

> [!Warning] Note
> [^3] is true for the line integral with respect to $x,y, or \ z$, but **not** with respect to arc length. This is because arc length is independent of the orientation of the path; **always** a positive quantity 

2. Suppose $C$ is a finite union of paths.

> [!Info] Sketch
> ![[Screenshot 2024-11-08 at 12.21.46 PM.png|350]]

To find $\int_{C}f \ d\partial$ (or dx), we add up the line integral of each piece, *e.g.*

$$
\int_{C}f \ d\partial = \int_{C_{1}}f \ d\partial + \int_{C_{2}}f \ d\partial + \dots + \int_{C_{4}}f \ d\partial
$$
