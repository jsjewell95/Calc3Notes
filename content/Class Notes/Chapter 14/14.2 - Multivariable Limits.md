We are all familiar with multivariable limits from calculus 2, so let's just start with a quick refresher.

## Refresher - Continuity

**Continuity** is the concept of a line having no breaks - otherwise known as a continuous flow with no disconnections.

A line is **continuous** when it is one, smooth stroke.

A line is **discontinuous** when there is a visible break or "jump" in the line's path.

## Bringing it to 3D

In Calculus 3, continuity in the 3D space means that we can **traverse a surface without interruption**

- No vertical "cliffs" or "walls" or "trenches"
- No points with "infinite height/depth"

_Discontinuity in 3d_

## Calculus 1 - f(x) is Continuous at A...

This usually means something like a limit of a function $f(x)$ is in of itself that limit $f(a)$,

**Where:**

$$ \lim\_{x\rightarrow a} {f(x)} = f(a) $$

In **Calculus 3** this is expanded apon for [[14.1 - Multivariable functions]], where we now have to deal with functions like $f(x,y)$

How do we deal with this?

It is actually quite simple, where we just add another letter to represent its inherent multivariability.

This introduces some interesting ideas, as there are now multiple different ways for us to reach the same answer.

As it turns out, for $\lim_{(x,y) \rightarrow (a,b)}{f(x,y)}$ , there are infinitely many ways for $(x,y)$ to approach $(a,b)$

This makes proving a limit exists all the more difficult, as you now must address the following cases.

> [!danger] Hard
> In order for a limit $L$ to exist, $f(x,y)$ must approach L as $(x,y)$ approaches $(a,b)$ along **every** path towards $(a,b)$

However, this also makes proving a limit is **DNE** a lot simpler.
