Curvature measures how fast a curve is changing direction at any given point. It is a critical concept in understanding the geometry of curves in space.

### 1. **Definition Of Curvature**

For a smooth curve, the curvature \( \kappa \) at a point is defined as the magnitude of the rate of change of the unit tangent vector with respect to arc length:

$$\kappa = \left| \frac{d\mathbf{T}}{ds} \right|
$$

where:

- $\mathbf{T}$ is the unit tangent vector to the curve.
- \( s \) is the arc length parameter.

### 2. **Curvature Formula for Parametric Curves**

If a curve is given by a vector-valued function \( \mathbf{r}(t) = \langle x(t), y(t), z(t) \rangle \), where \( t \) is a parameter, the curvature \( \kappa \) can be computed as:

$$\kappa = \frac{|\mathbf{r}'(t) \times \mathbf{r}''(t)|}{|\mathbf{r}'(t)|^3}
$$

#### Steps to Compute Curvature:

1. Find the first derivative \( \mathbf{r}'(t) \), which gives the velocity vector.
2. Find the second derivative \( \mathbf{r}''(t) \), which gives the acceleration vector.
3. Compute the cross product \( \mathbf{r}'(t) \times \mathbf{r}''(t) \).
4. Take the magnitude of the cross product and divide it by \( |\mathbf{r}'(t)|^3 \).

### 3. **Curvature Of a 2D Curve**

For a 2D curve, \( y = f(x) \), the curvature can be computed by the formula:

$$\kappa = \frac{|f''(x)|}{(1 + (f'(x))^2)^{3/2}}
$$

This formula comes from expressing the curve in parametric form and simplifying the general curvature formula.

### 4. **Geometric Interpretation**

- **High Curvature**: A curve bends sharply. A small change in arc length produces a large change in direction.
- **Low Curvature**: A curve is nearly straight. The direction changes slowly with respect to arc length.
- **Straight Line**: The curvature is zero since the direction does not change at all.

### 5. **Curvature Of a Circle**

For a circle of radius \( R \), the curvature is constant and equal to:

$$\kappa = \frac{1}{R}
$$

The larger the radius, the smaller the curvature, and vice versa.

### 6. **Applications**

- **Physics**: Describing the motion of particles along curved paths.
- **Engineering**: Design of roads and rails (e.g., banking of curves).
- **Geometry**: Analysis of surfaces and shapes in 3D space.

### 7. **Relation To Normal and Tangential Components**

The curvature is also related to the decomposition of the acceleration vector into tangential and normal components:

- The tangential component relates to the speed change.
- The normal component is proportional to the curvature and describes the change in direction.
