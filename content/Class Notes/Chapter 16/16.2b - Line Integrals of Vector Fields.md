In physics, the **work** done by a constant force acting on an object taht moves along a line is defined by $W = Force \times Distance$.

Where work done by $\vec{F}$ moving an object from $P$ to $Q$ is:

$$
Work = | \vec{F} | \cdot | \vec{PQ} |
$$

This vector $\vec{PQ}$ is called the **displacement vector**.

In the case where $\vec{F}$ is not parallel to $\vec{PW}$, we define:

$$
Work = | \vec{F} | \cos \theta \cdot | \vec{PQ} |
$$

[^1]

Where $\theta$ is the angle between $\vec{F}$ and $\vec{PQ}$. The interpretation of this definition is that we are multiplying the displacement vector $| \vec{PQ} |$ by the scalar projection of $\vec{F}$ onto $| \vec{PQ}|$.

From [^1], we can write:

$$
\begin{align*}
W &= | \vec{F} | \cdot | \vec{PQ} | \cos \theta \\
&= \vec{F} \cdot   \vec{PQ} \\
&\equiv \vec{F} \cdot \vec{D}
\end{align*}
$$

**Work** done by $\vec{F}$ in moving an object from $P$ to $Q$, where we define $\vec{D} = \vec{PQ}$ as the displacement vector.

## Line Integrals of Vector Fields

Now suppose $\vec{F}(x,y) = P(x,y) \vec{i} + Q(x,y) \vec{j}$ is a force vector field on $\mathbb{R}^2$. We seek to compute the work done by this force in moving a particle along a curve $C$.

> - $C$ is the curve $\vec{r}(t) = \langle x(t), y(t) \rangle, \ \ t \in [a,b]$
> - $\vec{F}$ is a vector field

To calculate the work, we partition $C$ into n sub-areas, estimate the work done over each sub-arc, and sum them all up.

In the right-hand image, $\vec{F}_{i} = \vec{F} (x_{i},y_{i})$, where $x_{i} = x(t_{i})$ and $y_{i}= y(t_{i})$, and $\vec{T}_{i}$ is the unit tangent vector to $\vec{r}(t)$ at $t_{i}$. Let $\Delta \partial_{i}$ denote the arc length of the sub-arc. As the particle moves along the curve, it moves approximately in the direction of $\vec{T}_{i}$, for a distance of $\Delta \partial_{i}$ units. We can therefore estimate the displacement vector by $\vec{D}_{i} = \vec{T}_{i}\Delta \partial_{i}$.

Using the formula $W = \vec{F}_{i} \cdot \vec{D}_{i}$, we find that the work done by $\vec{F}_{i}$ in moving the particle along $\vec{D}_{i}$ is:

$$
W = \vec{F}_{i} \cdot \vec{T}_{i} \ \Delta \partial_{i} \to Total \ Work = \sum_{i=0}^n \vec{F}_{i} \cdot \vec{T}_{i} \ \Delta \partial_{i}
$$

$$
\to Work = \int_{c} \vec{F}(x,y) \cdot \vec{T}(x,y) \ d\partial = \int_{c} \vec{F} \cdot \vec{T} \ d\partial
$$

This is called a line integral of a vector field. Using:

$$
\vec{T} = \frac{\vec{r}'(t)}{| \vec{r}'(t)|} \ \ \ and \ \ \ d\partial = | \vec{r}'(t) | \ dt
$$

we get:

$$
\int_{c} \vec{F} \cdot \vec{T} \ d\partial = \int_{c} \vec{F} \cdot \frac{\vec{r}'(t)}{| \vec{r}'(t) |} \cdot | \vec{r}'(t)| \ dt = \int_{c}  \vec{F} \cdot \vec{r}'(t) \ dt
$$

Using the differential $d\vec{r} = \vec{r}'(t) \ dt$, we can write:

$$
\int_{c} \vec{F} \cdot \vec{r}'(t) \ dt = \int_{c} \vec{F} \cdot d\vec{r}
$$

We summarize below:

## Remarks

1. The notation $\vec{F}(\vec{r}(t))$ is a shorthand. For example, if $\vec{F} = \vec{F}(x,y)$ and $\vec{r}(t)= \langle x(t), y(t) \rangle$, then $\vec{F}(\vec{r}(t)) = \vec{F}( x(t), y(t))$. 
2. The physical analogy of the vector line integral is the work done by the vector field in moving a particle along a curve.
3. Observe: if $\vec{F} = P \vec{i} + Q \vec{j} + R \vec{k}$ and $d\vec{r} = \langle dx, dy, dz \rangle$:

$$
\begin{align*}
\vec{F} \cdot d\vec{r} &= \langle P,Q,R \rangle \cdot \langle dx, dy , dz \rangle \\
&= P \ dx + Q \ dy + R \ dz
\end{align*}
$$

	Thus, vector line integrals can be broken down into line integrals with respect to $x,y,z$, etc.
