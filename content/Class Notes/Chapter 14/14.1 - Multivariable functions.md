## Definition: Function of 2 Variables f(x,y)

- $f(x,y)$ assigns every ordered pair $(x,y)$ in the domain $\mathcal{D}$ of f

- A unique number $z = f(x,y)$ in the range of $f$

## An Example Multivariable Function

Volume of a Cylinder:

$$ v(h,r) = \pi r^2 h $$

Filled out:

$$ v(2,3) = \pi 3^2 2 = 18 \pi $$

## Contour Maps

Simple Python MatplotLib contour map:

```python
import micropip
await micropip.install("numpy")
await micropip.install("matplotlib")

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D

# Create grid
x = np.linspace(-5, 5, 100)
y = np.linspace(-5, 5, 100)
x, y = np.meshgrid(x, y)

# Bowl shape (z = x^2 + y^2)
z = x**2 + y**2

# Create figure
fig = plt.figure()
ax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection="3d")

# Plot contour map
contour = ax.contour(x, y, z, levels=[5, 10, 15, 20, 25], cmap="viridis", extend3d=True)
ax.clabel(contour, inline=True, fontsize=10)

# Set labels
ax.set_xlabel("X")
ax.set_ylabel("Y")
ax.set_zlabel("Z")

# Add title
ax.set_title("3D Contour Map of Bowl Shape")

# Show plot
plt.show()
```

Now, projecting this onto a 2d plane:

```python
import micropip
await micropip.install("numpy")
await micropip.install("matplotlib")

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Create grid
x = np.linspace(-5, 5, 100)
y = np.linspace(-5, 5, 100)
x, y = np.meshgrid(x, y)

# Bowl shape (z = x^2 + y^2)
z = x**2 + y**2

# Create figure
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

# Plot 2D contour map with specified levels
contour = ax.contour(x, y, z, levels=[5, 10, 15, 20, 25], cmap='viridis')

# Label contours
ax.clabel(contour, inline=True, fontsize=10)

# Set labels
ax.set_xlabel('X')
ax.set_ylabel('Y')

# Add title
ax.set_title('2D Contour Map of Bowl Shape')

# Show plot
plt.show()
```

You might notice that the "tighter" the contours, the "steeper" the surface.

**How do you go back and forth between the projection and the 3d graph?**

### 2D Vs. 3D Contour Maps: Projection and Lifting

In a **3D contour map**, we're "lifting" the contours off the surface, giving each curve a specific height (or `z` value). Imagine slowly pulling up a flexible surface to see its shape in space. Each contour line represents a different height level, like a slice of the shape.

When we "squish" this back down into a **2D contour map**, we flatten the surface while still showing where those height changes occur. The heights aren't lost, but represented through lines on the flat plane, much like a **topographical map** of terrain. Each line corresponds to a different elevation, giving us a view of the shape without the 3D depth.

> [!NOTE]
> This is similar to how topographical maps show mountains and valleys. Instead of showing peaks, we use contour lines to indicate changes in elevation.

## Example

Let's make a contour map for the following equation:

$$\frac{x^2}{4} - \frac{y^2}{9} = z$$

In the plane $z=1$:

$$\frac{x^2}{4} - \frac{y^2}{9} = 1$$

Plotting this with `MatPlotLib` yields:

```python
import micropip
await micropip.install("numpy")
await micropip.install("matplotlib")

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create grid
x = np.linspace(-10, 10, 400)
y = np.linspace(-10, 10, 400)
x, y = np.meshgrid(x, y)

# Equation for z = 1: x^2 / 4 - y^2 / 9 = 1
z = (x**2 / 4) - (y**2 / 9)

# Create figure
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

# Plot the contour where z = 1
contour = ax.contour(x, y, z, levels=[1], colors="blue")

# plot the contour where z = 2
contour = ax.contour(x, y, z, levels=[2], colors="red")

# Plot the contour where z = 3
contour = ax.contour(x, y, z, levels=[3], colors="green")

# Label contours
ax.clabel(contour, inline=True, fontsize=10)

# Set labels
ax.set_xlabel("X")
ax.set_ylabel("Y")

# Add title
ax.set_title(r"Contour map for $\frac{x^2}{4} - \frac{y^2}{9} = 1$")

# Show plot
plt.show()
```

### Contour Density and Steepness

In a contour map, the spacing between lines reveals the **steepness** of the surface. When the contours are **far apart**, the elevation is changing gradually. But when the contours get **closer together**, the surface becomes steeper, showing a rapid change in elevation.

In the case of the hyperbolic contour map for $\frac{x^2}{4} - \frac{y^2}{9} = 1$, as the contours tighten around certain regions, it indicates that the surface is becoming much steeper there. This is similar to how, on a topographical map, closely packed lines represent a sharp incline on a mountain.

> [!NOTE]
> The tighter the contours, the faster the change in height, just like on steep slopes in nature!
