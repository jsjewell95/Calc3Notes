Let $C$ be a simple closed curve and let $\mathcal{D}$ be the region bounded by $C$. We say $C$ has **positive orientation** if $C$ is traversed in the **counterclockwise** direction.

## Abstract

> [!Success] Green's Theorem (named for George Green):
> Let $\mathcal{D}$ be a simply connected region whose boundary curve $C$ is a simple, closed, **positively oriented** curve. If $P(x,y)$ and $Q(x,y)$ have continuous first-order partials on some open region containing $\mathcal{D}$, then:

> $$
> \int_{C} P(x,y) \ dx + Q(x,y) \ dy = \int_{\mathcal{D}} \int \left( \frac{\partial Q}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial P}{\partial y} \right) \ dA
> $$

This theorem says that under certain conditions, we can evaluate a line integral as a double integral.

## Proving Green's Theorem

We will prove this for the special case where $\mathcal{D}$ is a **simple region**, meaning a region which is simultaneously Type I and Type II. We wish to show:

$$
\oint_{\partial \mathcal{d}} \vec{F} \cdot d\vec{r} = \oint_{\partial \mathcal{D}} P \ dx + Q \ dy = \int_{\mathcal{D}} \int (Q_{x}-P_{y}) \ dA
$$

We will do this by showing: 

$$
\oint_{\partial \mathcal{D}} P \ dx = - \int_{\mathcal{D}} P_{y} \ dA \ \ \ AND \oint_{\partial \mathcal{D}} Q \ dy = \int_{\mathcal{D}} Q_{x} \ dA \ \ \ \ (*)
$$

The result will follow by linearity of the integral.

Let $\mathcal{D}$ be a simple region with positively-oriented boundary curve $\partial \mathcal{D}$. Consider the case where we view $\mathcal{D}$ as a Type I region:

> 
> $\partial \mathcal{D}$ decomposed into $\partial \mathcal{D} - C_{1} \cup C_{2}$

We compute the first expression in `(*)` directly as:

$$
\oint_{\partial \mathcal{D}} P \ dx = \int_{C_{1}} P \ dx + \int_{C_{2}} P \ dx = \int_{C_{1}} P \ dx - \int_{-C_{2}} P \ dx \ \ \ \ (**)
$$

( The "negation" trick will help us soon. ) We can parameterize $C_{1}$ and $-C_{2}$ by:

$$
C_{1}: \ \ \ \langle t, y_{1}(t) \rangle \ \ \ t \in [a,b]
$$

$$
C_{2}: \ \ \ \langle t, y_{2}(t) \rangle \ \ \ t \in  [a,b]
$$

`(**)` is then:

$$
\begin{align*}
\oint_{\partial \mathcal{D}} P \ dx &= \int_{a}^b P (t,y_{1}(t)) \ dt - \int_{a}^b P(t, y_{2}(t)) \ dt \\
&= - \int_{a}^b P
\end{align*}
$$
