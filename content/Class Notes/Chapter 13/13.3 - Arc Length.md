Consider the following equation.

$$
y = f(x)
$$

Do you remember the Arc Length formula?

$$
l = \int_{a}^{b} \sqrt{1 + (f'(x))^2} dx
$$

This works normally for what we have been using it for. However, How can we apply this formula to vector arithmetic?

We can use the following for 2d

$$
l = \int_{t0}^{t1} \sqrt{(\frac{dy}{dt})^2 + (\frac{dx}{dt})^2} dt
$$

We can further this by applying it in 3D.

$$
l = \int_{t0}^{t1} \sqrt{(\frac{dz}{dt})^2 + (\frac{dy}{dt})^2 + (\frac{dx}{dt})^2} dt
$$

We can use this in terms of r prime using the following

$$
\int_{t0}^{t1} | \overline{r'}(t) | dt
$$

## Arc Length Function

We define the arc length function as s(t), where it is an integral from A to T instead

It is similar to the arc length formula, but returns a function for scalar operations

Formula:

$$
s(t) = \int_{a}^{t} | \overline{r'}(t) | dt
$$

We can differentiate it resulting in the following

$$
\frac{ds}{dt} = | \overline{r'}(t) |
$$

$$
\frac{4}{5} = 
$$
