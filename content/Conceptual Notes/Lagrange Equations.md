> [!summary] **Lagrange Multipliers**
> The method of Lagrange multipliers is a strategy to find the local maxima and minima of a function subject to one or more constraints. It introduces an auxiliary variable, the Lagrange multiplier, to convert a constrained optimization problem into a system of equations.

## The Lagrange Multiplier Method

For a function $f(x, y, z)$ subject to the constraint $g(x, y, z) = 0$, the Lagrange multiplier method involves solving the following system:

$$
\nabla f(x, y, z) = \lambda \nabla g(x, y, z)
$$

Where:

- $\nabla f(x, y, z)$ is the gradient of the function we want to optimize.
- $\nabla g(x, y, z)$ is the gradient of the constraint.
- $\lambda$ is the Lagrange multiplier.

In essence, the gradients of $f$ and $g$ must be parallel, reflecting that the rate of change of $f$ in the direction of the constraint is zero.

> [!abstract] **Geometric Interpretation**
> Lagrange multipliers provide a way of finding points where the function's gradient and the constraint's gradient are aligned, meaning that any further movement within the constraint will not increase or decrease the function's value.

## Lagrange Equations for Multiple Constraints

For problems with multiple constraints, say $g_1(x, y, z) = 0$ and $g_2(x, y, z) = 0$, the system of Lagrange equations becomes:

$$
\nabla f(x, y, z) = \lambda_1 \nabla g_1(x, y, z) + \lambda_2 \nabla g_2(x, y, z)
$$

Where:

- $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ are the Lagrange multipliers associated with each constraint.
- This leads to a system of equations that can be solved to find the critical points of $f$ subject to the given constraints.
