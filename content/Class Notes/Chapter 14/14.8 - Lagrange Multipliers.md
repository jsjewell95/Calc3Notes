Consider the problem of **maximizing** or **minimizing** some function $f(x,y)$, **subject to some constraint** $g(x,y) = k$

> [!Caution] Important
> $g(x,y)=k$ is a contour/level curve of some unknown constraint surface $z=f(x,y)$.

## Solving This Problem

1. We parameterize the constraint curve $g(x,y)=k$ by 

$$\vec{r}(t)=\langle x(t), y(t) \rangle$$

By the [[14.6 - Tangent Planes Revisited#Important Information|Key Formula]] from Sec. 14.6,

$$\nabla g \cdot \vec{r}'(t) = 0$$

for all t in the parameter domain.

2. The curve `C` whose optimal value we seek is obtained by lifting $\vec{r}(t)$ to the surface $z=f(x,y)$.

This means we can parameterize `C` by

$$\vec{c}(t) = \langle x(t), y(t), f(x(t), y(t)) \rangle$$

> [!Warning] Observe
> The max/min values along $\vec{c}$ may occur when the z-component of $\vec{c}' s$ tangent vector equals 0.

>[!Question] Why?
> In complete analogy with Calc 1, we want to look where $\vec{c}$ has a horizontal tangent line. In $\mathbb{R}^3$
