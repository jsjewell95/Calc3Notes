In the previous lecture, we examined $\int \int_{R} f(x,y) dA$, where $R$ was a rectangular region in the xy-plane. Now we examine the more general case:

$$\int \int _{\mathcal{D}} f(x,y) dA$$

Where $\mathcal{D}$ is a region of any shape in the xy-plane.

## Abstract

Suppose we have a graph that looks like the following:

>[!Info] Sketch
> ![[Screenshot 2024-10-04 at 12.17.44 PM.png]]

$\int \int_{\mathcal{D}} f(x,y) dA$ can be interpreted as the volume of the solid below the surface S and above the region $\mathcal{D}$

### Simple Regions

We will examine the special case where $\mathcal{D}$ is a **simple region**. Two types of simple regions are **vertically simple** (called **[[15.2 - Double Integrals Over General Regions#Type 1 Region|Type 1]]**) and **Horizontally Simple** (called **[[15.2 - Double Integrals Over General Regions#Type 2 Region|Type 2]]**)

#### Type 1 Region

$\mathcal{D}$ lies completely between the continuous functions $g_{1}(x)$ and $g_{2}(x)$

#### Type 2 Region

$\mathcal{D}$ lies completely between the continuous functions $h_{1}(y)$ and $h_{2}(y)$

>[!Warning] Remark
> We have dealt with simple regions before; in Calc. 1, we found the area of simple regions in "Area Between Curves" type problems.

To find a double integral over a simple region, we follow an approach similar to the proof of [[15.1.2 - Iterated Integrals#Proof of Fubini's Theorem|Fubini's Theorem]]. Let $z=f(x,y)$ be defined of the [[15.2 - Double Integrals Over General Regions#Type 1 Region|Type 1]] region $\mathcal{D}$

The idea is to divide the interval $[a,b]$ into $n$ subintervals of width:

$$\nabla x = \frac{{b-a}}{n}$$

then add up the volume of the n **Slabs**:

$$\int \int_{\mathcal{D}} f(x,y)dA \approx \sum_{i=1}^n (volume \ of \ Slab \ i)$$

The volume of "Slab i" is the width $(\nabla x)$ times the area of the face, which is the 2D-integral

$$(Area \ of \ face \ i) = \int_{g_{1}(x_{i})}^{g_{2}(x_{i})}f(x_{i},y) \ dy$$

>[!Warning] Note
> Note the limits of integration on the y-axis

The double integral is therefore approximated by:

$$\int \int_{\mathcal{D}} f(x,y)dA \approx \sum_{i=1}^n\left( \int_{g_{1}(x_{i})}^{g_{2}(x_{i})}f(x_{i},y)dy \right)\Delta x$$

Taking the limit $n \rightarrow \infty$, we get the following result:

>[!done] Result
> If $f$ is continuous on the **Type 1** region
>
> $$\mathcal{D} = \{(x,y): a \leq x \leq b, \ \ g_{1}(x) \leq y \leq g_{2}(x) \}$$
>
> then:
>
> $$\int \int_{\mathcal{D}} f(x,y) dA = \int_{a}^b \int_{g_{1}(x)}^{g_{2}(x)}f(x,y) \ dy \ dx$$

A similar argument for **Type 2** regions yields:

>[!Done] Result

> $$\mathcal{D} = \{ (x,y): h_{1} \leq x \leq h_{2}(y), \ \ c \leq y \leq d \}$$

> $$\int \int _{\mathcal{D}} f(x,y) dA = \int_{c}^d \int_{h_{1}(y)}^{h_{2}(y)}f(x,y) \ dx \ dy$$

## Remarks

1. Note how the order of integration is different in each case. In both cases, we integrate the variable whose integration limits can be written in terms of the other variable **first**.
2. **DO NOT** "blindly" swap the order of integration. That only works for rectangular regions. We **can** change the order of integration, but **it will involve finding new integration limits**.

We can see that $\mathcal{D}$ is **Type 1**:

- $1=x^2 \leq y \leq 2x^2$
- $-1 \leq x \leq 1$

**The double integral is therefore:**

*Set-up for Type 1 region*

$$\int \int_{\mathcal{D}}(x+2y) \ dA = \int_{-1}^1 \int_{2x^2}^{1+x^2}(x+2y) \ dy \ dx$$

*Integrate with respect to y*

$$= \int_{-1}^1 \left.(xy+y^2  \right|_{y=2x^2}^{y=1+x^2}) \ dx$$

*Integrate with respect to x*

$$\int_{-1}^11+x+2x^2-x^3-3x^4 \ dx$$

*Final Answer*

$$\frac{32}{15}$$

## Remarks

1. This example illustrates the procedure for when we integrate first with respect to `y` and then with respect to `x`. We "integrate out the y" to obtain an integrand entirely in terms of `x`, which we evaluate to get a constant.
2.  **Setting up the double integral is the important part**. We can use Mathematica to handle the actual integration.

## Example

>[!Example]
> Find the volume of the solid that lies under the paraboloid $z = x^2 + y^2$ and above the region $\mathcal{D}$ in the xy-plane, bounded by the line $y=2x$ and $y=x^2$

>[!Success] Solution
> **Sketch the region $\mathcal{D}$**

- **As a type 1 region:**
	- $0 \leq x \leq 2$, $x^2\leq y\leq 2x$
- **As a type 2 region:**
	- $\frac{y}{2} \leq x \leq \sqrt{ y }$ ,  $0 \leq y \leq 4$


**We can set up the integral two ways:**

Type 1:

$$\int_{0}^2 \int_{x^2}^{2x} (x^2 +y^2) \ dy \ dx = \frac{216}{35}$$

Type 2:

$$\int_{0}^4 \int_{\frac{y}{2}}^{\sqrt{ y }}(x^2 + y^2) \ dx \ dy = \frac{216}{35}$$

**Pick whichever integral is easier to find**

## Example

>[!Example]
> Find hte volume of the tetrahedron bounded by the planes:
>
> $$x+2y+z=2, \ \ \ x=2y, \ \ \ x=0, \ \ \ and \ \ \ z=0$$

>[!Success] Solution
> Sometimes, we have to sketch the solid in order to determine the region of integration. Let's start by sketching the part of the plane in the first octant:

> [!Info] Sketch
> ![[Screenshot 2024-10-07 at 12.41.09 PM.png]]

**Now sketch the integration region $\mathcal{D}$ in the xy-plane:**

>[!Info] Sketch
> ![[Screenshot 2024-10-07 at 12.42.06 PM.png]]

$(1,\frac{1}{2})$ is the point of intersection of the two lines.

As a **Type 1** region,

$$\mathcal{D} = \left\{  (x,y) \ : \ 0 \leq x \leq 1 \ , \ \frac{x}{2} \leq y \leq 1 - \frac{x}{2} \right\}$$

(we got the bounds on y because $x=2y \rightarrow y = \frac{x}{2}, \ \ x +2y=2 \rightarrow y=1 - \frac{x}{2}$)

The volume of the tetrahedron is the volume above $\mathcal{D}$ and below the plane $x + 2y + z = 2$, which we can express as $z = 2-x-2y$.

**The double integral is:**

$$\int \int_{\mathcal{D}} f(x,y) dA = \int_{0}^1 \int_{\frac{x}{2}}^{1-\left( \frac{x}{2} \right)}2-x-2y \ dy \ dx = \frac{1}{3}$$

## Changing the order of Integration

We will now examine how to handle changing the order of integration over non-rectangular region of integration.

>[!Example]
> Evaluate:
>
> $$\int_{0}^1 \int_{x}^1 \sin(y^2) \ dy \ dx$$

> [!Success] Solution
> This integral calls for a different order because we cant integrate $\sin(y^2)$ with respect to y ( this is a **[[Fresnel Integral]]**) 

We can work backwards to find limits of integration for the order $dx \ dy$. By reading the original integral, we see that $\mathcal{D}$ is the region where $y$ "runs" from $y=x$ to $y=1$, and $x$ "runs" from $x=0$ to $x=1$

>[!Info] Sketch
> ![[Screenshot 2024-10-07 at 12.24.45 PM.png]]

**Integration Region $\mathcal{D}$** ( type 1):

$$0 \leq x \leq 1, \ \ \ x \leq y \leq 1$$

**Equivalently** (type 2):

$$0 \leq x \leq y, \ \ \ 0 \leq y \leq 1$$

From the **Sketch**, we see that $\mathcal{D}$ is treated as a Type 1 region in the original integral. If we treat $\mathcal{D}$ as a Type 2 region, the integral becomes:

$$\int _{0}^1 \int _{0}^y \sin(y^2) \ dx \ dy = \frac{1}{2}(1-\cos 1)$$

This changed the order of integration and gave us something we are able to integrate.

## Finding Area Using Double Integrals

Observe that:

$$\int \int_{\mathcal{D}} 1 dA = A(\mathcal{D})$$

Where $A(\mathcal{D})$ means the area of region $\mathcal{D}$. This is because the integral represents the volume of the solid below the plane $z=1$ and above the region $\mathcal{D}$, which is merely a cylinder:

>[!Info] Sketch
> ![[Screenshot 2024-10-07 at 12.30.14 PM.png]]

Where:

$$Volume = (Area \ of \ base) \ \cdot \ height$$

$$= A(\mathcal{D}) \ \cdot \ 1$$

$$\int \int_{\mathcal{D}} 1 dA$$

> In 2D, $\int_{a}^b \ 1 \ dx$ gives the length of the interval of integration. So,
