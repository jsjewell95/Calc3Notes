The **spherical coordinates $(\rho, \phi, \theta)$** of a point **P** in space have the following meaning:

Where:

- $\rho$ is the distance from the origin to `P` ($\phi \geq 0$)
- $\theta$ is the polar angle in the xy-plane ($0 \leq \theta \leq 2\pi$)
- $\phi$ is the angle between the z-axis and the segment from the origin to `P` ($0 \leq \phi \leq \pi$)

> [!Abstract] Remark
> $\phi$ ranges from $0$ to $\pi$. Because $\theta$ ranges from $0$ to $2\pi$, we can always capture the "left" side of the yz-plane.

> [!Example] Examples of Surfaces in Spherical Coordinates
> 1. $\rho = c$ represents a sphere of radius $c$. Distance from the pole is fixed; $\phi$ and $\theta$ sweep out the sphere.
> 2. $\phi = c$ represents a cone. Angle between the cone and z-axis are fixed; $\theta$ sweeps out the cone and $\rho$ stretches it.

Let $p'$ be the projection of $P$ onto the xy-plane. The $x$ and $y$ coordinates of $P'$ ( and hence $P$ ) are described in polar coordinates by:

$$
x = r\cos \theta, \ \ \ y = r\sin \theta \ \ \ (*)
$$

where $r$ is the distance from the origin to $p'$.

> $$
> x = \rho \sin \phi \cos \theta, \ \ \ y = \rho \sin \phi \sin \theta

From the [[15.8 - Triple Integrals in Spherical Coordinates#Conversion Formulae Spherical to Cartesian|figure]], we also see: 

$$
\cos \phi = \frac{z}{\rho} \rightarrow z = \rho \cos \phi
$$

Because $\rho$ is the distance from the point to the origin:

$$
\rho^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2
$$

Another useful conversion:

$$
x^2 + y^2 = r^2 = \rho^2 \sin^2 \phi
$$

## Triple Integrals in Spherical Coordinates

Suppose $E$ is a region described conveniently in spherical coordinates:

> [!Info] Sketch
> ![[Screenshot 2024-10-30 at 12.27.20 PM.png|350]]

The $\color{blue}volume \ element \ dV$ is a "spherical wedge" whose face we have shaded in blue. The volume of this wedge is:

$$
dV = (Area \ of \ Face) \cdot Height = (Area \ of \ Face) \Delta \rho
$$

We can approximate the area of the face by:

$$
Area \ of \ Face = Width \cdot Length
$$

The $width$ is the length of the circular arc with angle $\Delta \phi$ and radius $\rho$:

$$
Width = \rho \Delta \phi
$$

The $length$ is the length of the circular arc with angle $\Delta \theta$ and radius $r=\rho \sin \phi$. (We determined this on the previous part.) So, $length = \rho \sin \phi \Delta \theta$

**Putting it all together:**

$$
dV = (Area \ of \ Face) \cdot Height
$$

$$
= Length \cdot Width \cdot Height
$$

$$
= (\rho \sin \phi \Delta \theta) \cdot (\rho \Delta \phi) \cdot \Delta \rho
$$

$$
= \rho^2 \sin \phi \ \Delta \rho \ \Delta \phi \ \Delta \theta \rightarrow \color{gold} \rho^2 \sin \phi \ d\rho \ d \phi \ d\theta
$$

Where $\color{gold} \rho^2 \sin \phi \ d\rho \ d\phi \ d\theta$ is the $\color{gold} Spherical \ Volume \ Element$

**The triple integral formula is then:**

$$
\int \int_{E} \int f(x,y,z) dV = \int_{\theta_{1}}^{\theta_{2}} \int_{\phi_{1}}^{\phi_{2}} \int_{\rho_{1}}^{\rho_{2}} f(x,y,z) \ \rho^2 \ \sin \phi \ d\rho \ d\phi \ d\theta
$$
