A **vector field** is a function that associates a point with a vector. An example is Earth's **gravitational field**:

The **Earth** exerts an attractive force on a point-mass located anywhere inthe universe. At every point $P$, wer draw a vector pointing in the direction of the attractive force with length equal to the magnitude of the force.

_(according to Newton, the magnitude of the force is inversely proportional to the distance from the point to the Earth.)_

Vector fields are convenient for problems involving **Flow**. Consider the problem of water flowing through a stream:

At every point in the stream, we can assign a vector whivh tells use the direction the water is moving. The magnitude of the vector tells us the velocity of the water at that point.

## Notation

The vector field $\vec{F}$ has the notation:

$$
\vec{F} (x,y) = P(x,y) \vec{i} + Q(x,y) \vec{i} = \langle {(x,y), Q(x,y)} \rangle
$$

Where $P$ and $Q$ are scalar functions.

> [!Example]
> Sketch the vector field $\vec{F} = x \vec{i} + y \vec{j}= \langle x,y \rangle$

> [!Success]- Solution
> When we input the point $(x,y)$, $\vec{F}$ outputs the vector $\langle x,y\rangle$. **Meaning:** at the point $(x,y)$, we sketch the position vector $\langle x,y \rangle$.

## Vector Fields in Mathematica

Sketching vector fields by hand is very tedious, especially if the vector field is 3-dimensional, e.g. $\vec{F}=y \vec{i} + z \vec{j} + x \vec{k}$.

**MUST SEE:** the Mathematica file called "vector fields" for a demo of the `VectorPlot` and `VectorPlot3D` commands

**EXTRA:** we can also use MatPlotLib to do the same

_note: my code interpreter does not allow for a dynamic canvas just yet, so if you want the full render run this code on your own machine._

```python-r
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D

# Define the grid range and resolution
x = np.linspace(-2, 2, 10)
y = np.linspace(-2, 2, 10)
z = np.linspace(-2, 2, 10)
X, Y, Z = np.meshgrid(x, y, z)

# Define the vector field components
U = Y  # i-component (y-component of the field)
V = Z  # j-component (z-component of the field)
W = X  # k-component (x-component of the field)

# Plot the vector field
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
ax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d')

# Create the quiver plot
ax.quiver(X, Y, Z, U, V, W, length=0.2, normalize=True, color='b', arrow_length_ratio=0.5)

# Set plot limits and labels
ax.set_xlim([-2, 2])
ax.set_ylim([-2, 2])
ax.set_zlim([-2, 2])
ax.set_xlabel('X')
ax.set_ylabel('Y')
ax.set_zlabel('Z')
ax.set_title(r'3D Vector Field $\vec{F} = y \vec{i} + z \vec{j} + x \vec{k}$')

plt.show()
```

## Gradient Vector Fields

Recall that $\nabla f = \langle f_{x}, f_{y}, f_{z} \rangle = f_{x} \vec{i} + f_{y} \vec{j} +f_{z} \vec{k}$. Thus, the gradient vector is really a vector field.

> [!Example]
> The gradient vector field for $f(x,y) = x^2y-y^3$, superimposed on the contour map. As we would expect, the gradient vectors are perpendicular to the contours.

## Conservative Vector Fields

We say $\vec{F}$ is a **conservative vector field** if $\vec{F} = \nabla f$ for some scalar function $f$. In this context, $f$ is called a **potential function** for $\vec{F}$. Conservative vector fields will be important to us soon...
